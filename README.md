Pyrat... Made by NotAidan
-----------------------------

Welcome to Pyrat. A simple script that makes a backdoor for windows.
At the moment Pyrat can only run command prompt commands but in the future it will be better

-----------------------------

when you finish making a back door there will be multiple new folders... you can delete all of them besides the "dist" which contains the backdoor itself

----------------------------

to start up Pyrat just unzip the following folder and run the command: python main.py
