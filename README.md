Pyrat... Made by NotAidan
-----------------------------

Welcome to Pyrat. A simple script that makes a backdoor for windows.
At the moment Pyrat can only run command prompt commands but in the future it will be better

-----------------------------

once finished with generating the backdoor it will be contained in a folder called "dist". You can delete the rest of the folders besides ".idea" which is the configurations for the python file

-----------------------------

to start up Pyrat just unzip the following folder and run the command: python main.py
